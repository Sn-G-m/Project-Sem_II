## Face Recognition Attendance System


Automation of attendance taking process with a pre-trained face detection and face recognition model. This is capable of capturing images of face and add it to a dataset which then can be trained for recogntion.

### Features
#### Face detection and Image capturing

Face is recognised using a CAFFE framework model, which is a pre-trained model for object detection. It is associated with Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD) framework. This is a deep learning architecture for object detection. 
The option "Add Applicant" enables us to take pictures of individuals and save it under a specified name. Since the model is trained particularly for face detection, it crops out rest of the area and focusses only on face thereby creating a much reliable dataset.
